	Abstract = {Deep neural networks have become invaluable tools for supervised machine learning, e.g.,
classification of text or images. While often offering superior results over traditional techniques
and successfully expressing complicated patterns in data, deep architectures are known to be
challenging to design and train such that they generalize well to new data. Critical issues with
deep architectures are numerical instabilities in derivative-based learning algorithms commonly
called exploding or vanishing gradients. In this paper, we propose new forward propagation
techniques inspired by systems of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) that overcome this
challenge and lead to well-posed learning problems for arbitrarily deep networks.
The backbone of our approach is our interpretation of deep learning as a parameter estimation problem of nonlinear dynamical systems. Given this formulation, we analyze stability
and well-posedness of deep learning and use this new understanding to develop new network
architectures. We relate the exploding and vanishing gradient phenomenon to the stability of
the discrete ODE and present several strategies for stabilizing deep learning for very deep networks. While our new architectures restrict the solution space, several numerical experiments
show their competitiveness with state-of-the-art networks.},

discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden
state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a blackbox differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant
memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade
numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth
residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct
continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum
likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we
show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its
internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.},

@article{gholami2019anode,
	Abstract = {Residual neural networks can be viewed as the
forward Euler discretization of an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) with a unit time step. This has recently motivated
researchers to explore other discretization approaches and train
ODE based networks. However, an important challenge of neural
ODEs is their prohibitive memory cost during gradient backpropogation. Recently a method proposed in [8], claimed that
this memory overhead can be reduced from O(LNt), where
Nt is the number of time steps, down to O(L) by solving
forward ODE backwards in time, where L is the depth of
the network. However, we will show that this approach may
lead to several problems: (i) it may be numerically unstable for
ReLU/non-ReLU activations and general convolution operators,
and (ii) the proposed optimize-then-discretize approach may lead
to divergent training due to inconsistent gradients for small
time step sizes. We discuss the underlying problems, and to
address them we propose ANODE, an Adjoint based Neural
ODE framework which avoids the numerical instability related
problems noted above, and provides unconditionally accurate
gradients. ANODE has a memory footprint of O(L) + O(Nt),
with the same computational cost as reversing ODE solve. We
furthermore, discuss a memory efficient algorithm which can
further reduce this footprint with a trade-off of additional
computational cost. We show results on Cifar-10/100 datasets
using ResNet and SqueezeNext neural networks.},

@article{onken2020discretize,
	Abstract = {We compare the discretize-optimize (Disc-Opt) and optimize-discretize (Opt-Disc) approaches for
time-series regression and continuous normalizing flows using neural ODEs. Neural ODEs, first
described in Chen et al. (2018), are ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with neural network
components; these models have competitively solved a variety of machine learning applications.
Training a neural ODE can be phrased as an optimal control problem where the neural network
weights are the controls and the hidden features are the states. Every iteration of gradient-based
training involves solving an ODE forward in time and another backward in time, which can require
large amounts of computation, time, and memory. Gholami et al. (2019) compared the Opt-Disc
and Disc-Opt approaches for neural ODEs arising as continuous limits of residual neural networks
used in image classification tasks. Their findings suggest that Disc-Opt achieves preferable performance due to the guaranteed accuracy of gradients. In this paper, we extend this comparison to
neural ODEs applied to time-series regression and continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). Timeseries regression and CNFs differ from classification in that the actual ODE model is needed in the
prediction and inference phase, respectively. Meaningful models must also satisfy additional requirements, e.g., the invertibility of the CNF. As the continuous model satisfies these requirements
by design, Opt-Disc approaches may appear advantageous. Through our numerical experiments,
we demonstrate that with careful numerical treatment, Disc-Opt methods can achieve similar performance as Opt-Disc at inference with drastically reduced training costs. Disc-Opt reduced costs
in six out of seven separate problems with training time reduction ranging from 39% to 97%, and
in one case, Disc-Opt reduced training from nine days to less than one day.},

forecasting can significantly improve decision making processes
in the smart power grid for better integrating renewable energy sources such as wind. Whereas point forecasting provides
a single expected value, probabilistic forecasts provide more

of a novel approach for nonparametric probabilistic forecasting
of wind power that combines a smooth approximation of the

a weighting initialization scheme to prevent the quantile cross

10%, to 90% prediction intervals which are evaluated using a

achieved impressive performance on a wide spectrum of tasks. Quantifying predictive uncertainty in NNs is a challenging and yet unsolved problem. Bayesian
NNs, which learn a distribution over weights, are currently the state-of-the-art
for estimating predictive uncertainty; however these require significant modifications to the training procedure and are computationally expensive compared to
standard (non-Bayesian) NNs. We propose an alternative to Bayesian NNs that
is simple to implement, readily parallelizable, requires very little hyperparameter
tuning, and yields high quality predictive uncertainty estimates. Through a series
of experiments on classification and regression benchmarks, we demonstrate that
our method produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates which are as good or
better than approximate Bayesian NNs. To assess robustness to dataset shift, we
evaluate the predictive uncertainty on test examples from known and unknown
distributions, and show that our method is able to express higher uncertainty on
out-of-distribution examples. We demonstrate the scalability of our method by

BNE augments a model's prediction and distribution functions using Bayesian

predictive uncertainty into distinct components that are due to different sources of

@inproceedings{tagasovska2019single,
	Abstract = {We provide single-model estimates of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty for deep
neural networks. To estimate aleatoric uncertainty, we propose Simultaneous
Quantile Regression (SQR), a loss function to learn all the conditional quantiles
of a given target variable. These quantiles can be used to compute well-calibrated
prediction intervals. To estimate epistemic uncertainty, we propose Orthonormal
Certificates (OCs), a collection of diverse non-constant functions that map all
training samples to zero. These certificates map out-of-distribution examples to
non-zero values, signaling epistemic uncertainty. Our uncertainty estimators are
computationally attractive, as they do not require ensembling or retraining deep
models, and achieve competitive performance.},
	Annote = {They propose a model to handle both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

y_true - y_predict,W = F_true(x1, x2)  - F_W*(x1)	=> approximation uncertainty
				+ F_W*(x1) - F_W(x1)		=> epistemic uncertainty
				+ epsilon					=> aleatoric uncertainty

They also mention approximation uncertainty, which could be defined as model misspecification. That is,
the erorr due to the fact that the model doesn't have enought capacity. In their own words, 
the ``approximation uncertainty describes the errors made by simplistic models unable to fit complex data 
(e.g., the error made by a linear model fitting a sinusoidal curve)''. However, they make the assumption that this
error is always zero since they focus on deep learning models that are known to have large capacity.

Note: I think there is also the case of hidden variables, and this could happen to any model. 
Some authors (e.g., WIkipedia) consider the case of hidden variables to be epistemic uncertainty, probably because
this is something we may be able to act upon (find out that data and measure it). This could be reconciled
if we consider approximation uncertainty as a special case of epistemic uncertainty (understood in a broad sense). That's
exactly what they do in the paper ``Accurate Uncertainty Estimation and Decomposition in Ensemble Learning''.

Aleatoric uncertainty:
They define aleatoric uncertainty as the uncertainty that accounts for the sotchasticity of the data.
They propose a method called Simultaneous Quantile Regression (SQR) which attempts to estimate all quantiles at once. 
It does so by training for different quantiles, chosent randomly at train time.

Epistemic uncertainty:
They say: ``epistemic uncertainty (from the Greek word episteme, meaning
``knowledge'') describes the errors associated to the lack of experience of our model at certain regions
of the feature space. Therefore, epistemic uncertainty is inversely proportional to the density of
training examples, and could be reduced by collecting data in those low density regions.''
Later in the paper, they clarify their position as the one of ``out-of-domain'' data, that is data
that was seen during training.
I think epistmic uncertainty, in general, includes everything you could theoretically act upon, or
throw more money at it (more data collection, more compute power,{\ldots}). But probably they assume
that everything within our control has already been tried. So only remains the lack of sufficient data 
in certain region of the data space, i.e., out-of-distribution samples.
How they handle epistemic uncertainty: they train certificates, that is functions that are trained to return
0 for all in-sample data and 1 for out-of-sample data, but are only trained on in-sample data (1-class classification).
They train an ensemble of certificates. You can use linear certificates or more complicated non-linear models. When 
using more complicated models (like DL), you need to constrain the certificates to prevent having them learn the zero map.
The solution is to impose orthogonality.
They apply their technique to out-of-dsitribution detection, and compare favorably with the BALD method (used in active learning).
However, I don't see how that technique could be used to estimate the variance error due to the epistemic uncertainty. Which is
what we would need to do uncertainty quantification.},

can potentially significantly improve DNNs prediction performance by trading-off

level. At test time, the classifier rejects instances as needed, to grant the desired
risk (with high probability). Empirical results over CIFAR and ImageNet convincingly demonstrate the viability of our method, which opens up possibilities to
operate DNNs in mission-critical applications. For example, using our method an
unprecedented 2% error in top-5 ImageNet classification can be guaranteed with
probability 99.9%, and almost 60% test coverage.},

Page Views and Revenue) of their applications and services in real
time. At Microsoft, we develop a time-series anomaly detection service which helps customers to monitor the time-series continuously
and alert for potential incidents on time. In this paper, we introduce the pipeline and algorithm of our anomaly detection service,
which is designed to be accurate, efficient and general. The pipeline
consists of three major modules, including data ingestion, experimentation platform and online compute. To tackle the problem
of time-series anomaly detection, we propose a novel algorithm
based on Spectral Residual (SR) and Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). Our work is the first attempt to borrow the SR model from
visual saliency detection domain to time-series anomaly detection.
Moreover, we innovatively combine SR and CNN together to improve the performance of SR model. Our approach achieves superior
experimental results compared with state-of-the-art baselines on
both public datasets and Microsoft production data.},
	Annote = {Introduce the pipeline and algorithm of our anomaly detection service

Pipelines comprise of 3 major modules:
*  data ingestion, 
* experimentation platform and 
* online compute

Challenges in designing an industrial service for time-series anomaly detection:
* Lack of labels => supervised setting inappropriate
* Generalization: may different patterns, and no method works for all time series patterns
* Efficiency/Scalability: needs model that can process lots of time series very fast (large accurate models are too slow)

Their method is based on
* saliency map: this is generated by some sort of average of the log(amplitude) in Fourier space (over a sliding window), then reverting that average back to time domain (with the phase untouched)
* followed by a CNN trained on synthetic saliency maps to automatically idenfity where an anomaly occured

Overall an interesting paper. They also mention a lot of the standard methods.
Their appliations seem to be mostly periodic time series. It would need to be tested on non-stationary time series. But in the case of trend stationarity, it seems the Fourier transform would be able to handle that.},

	Abstract = {Identifying causal relationships and quantifying their strength from observational time series data are key
problems in disciplines dealing with complex dynamical systems such as the Earth system or the human body.
Data-driven causal inference in such systems is challenging since datasets are often high dimensional and nonlinear with
limited sample sizes. Here, we introduce a novel method that flexibly combines linear or nonlinear conditional independence tests with a causal discovery algorithm to estimate causal networks from large-scale time series datasets.
We validate the method on time series of well-understood physical mechanisms in the climate system and the human
heart and using large-scale synthetic datasets mimicking the typical properties of real-world data. The experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detection power, which opens up entirely
new possibilities to discover and quantify causal networks from time series across a range of research fields.},
	Annote = {Paper where is introduced the PCMCI algorithm, which is an example of causal network learning algorithm specialized for time series data.

Additional material: https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/suppl/2019/11/21/5.11.eaau4996.DC1/aau4996_SM.pdf

The claim to fame of PCMCI is its capacity to handle high-dimensional datasets and highly interdependent time series, along with linear and nonlinear relationship in the data. In the paper, they also show some robustness to nonstationarity. The main shortcomings remain the reliance on the Causality Sufficiency hypothesis. The PCMCI algorithm builds on top of the PC algorithm. The latter is a Markov discovery algorithm that relies on the causal Markov property to identify parents of a variable. However, as shown in the paper, the PC algorithm cannot be used as is with time series. So the authors add a momentary condition independence (MCI) test after the PC step. The PC step (PC1) iteratively removes links that are independent conditioned on the most important drivers in the previous step. After that PC1 step, each variable is left with the causal parents and potentially some false positives. The MCI step tests each potential causal link and assess causal strenght. The MCI step conditions on the parents and the parents of the potential parent tested (to account for autocorrelation). The significance level to reject/accept the independence test in the MCI step is the one parameter of the method that can be adjusted; it can selected via typical techniques (information theory, or cross-validation). Any kinf of conditional independence test can be used in this algorithm, whether linear (e.g., linear partical correlation) or nonlinear (e.g., GPDC, or CMI).},

@article{runge2019inferring,
	Abstract = {The heart of the scientific enterprise is a rational effort to understand the causes behind
the phenomena we observe. In large-scale complex dynamical systems such as the Earth
system, real experiments are rarely feasible. However, a rapidly increasing amount of
observational and simulated data opens up the use of novel data-driven causal methods
beyond the commonly adopted correlation techniques. Here, we give an overview of causal
inference frameworks and identify promising generic application cases common in Earth
system sciences and beyond. We discuss challenges and initiate the benchmark platform
causeme.net to close the gap between method users and developers.},
	Annote = {Because intervention are hard (impossible?) to put in place in Earth science, there is a strong need to rely on recent data-driven methods (observational causal discovery). They give a few examples of situations where causality was used in Earth science, in particular examples where Granger causality and/or correlation-based methods failed to identify the correct causal links. Next, they introduced the main methods for causality inference with time seriesa. Many (?) causal inference methods for time series are grounded on a few common assumptions: time-order (past events influence future events, not the other way around), causal sufficiency (no unobserved common factor exists), for graphical models the Causal Markov condition (conditional independence on all variables who don't have a direct impact),{\ldots} They first introduce Granger causality, which is probably the foundational method of causal inference in time series. The high-level idea to assess whether variable X causes variable Y is to test whether knowledge of past values of X help improve or not the prediction of future values of Y (reduction in residual variance). Different variations of that idea have been developped over the years, mainly depending on the type of model that is used to predict Y: AR, nonlinear, or transfer entropy (a non-parametric statistic measuring the amount of directed time-asymmetric transfer of information between 2 random processes; the amount of information is measured using Shannon's entropy). One potential limitation of Granger causality is that it can only detect ``lagged causality'', i.e., causal relation coming from past data; if the idea is to apply a causality screening prior to forecast, then this is probably sufficient as we'll only rely on past information. On the other hand, Granger causality typically fails to identify conditionally independent links. Also, multivariate extensions of GC fail if too many variables are considered. Next, they discuss nonlinear state-space methods, in particular convergent cross-mapping (CCM) methods. These methods look for interactions in the underlying dynamic process that generated the data. They don't say much about that class of methods, except that CCM is not well suited for multivariate, purely stochastic processes, as it doesn't explicitly condition on other variables. Causal network learning algorithms use probabilistic graphical models (think Bayesian networks) to infer causality structure. They work well in large-scale applications. There are 2 main families of methods depending whether one starts from an empty graph and add links, or one starts from a fully connected graph and remove links. The decision to add/remove links is based on the results of some tests (e.g., conditional independence statistical test, or some score function,{\ldots}). They highlight 2 methods: PCMCI, designed to handle auto-correlated and nonlinear time series, and FCI which does not rely on the Causal Sufficiency assumption. Lastly, the structural causal model (SCM) framework, promoted by Judea Pearl. Causal graphs cannot always identify the direction of contemporaneous causality links (i.e., within the Markov equivalence class). SCM allows to make assumptions about the possible causal relationships we accept.},

	Abstract = {Are two sets of observations drawn from the same distribution? This problem is
a two-sample test. Kernel methods lead to many appealing properties. Indeed
state-of-the-art approaches use the L2 distance between kernel-based distribution
representatives to derive their test statistics. Here, we show that Lp distances
(with p  1) between these distribution representatives give metrics on the space
of distributions that are well-behaved to detect differences between distributions
as they metrize the weak convergence. Moreover, for analytic kernels, we show
that the L1 geometry gives improved testing power for scalable computational
procedures. Specifically, we derive a finite dimensional approximation of the
metric given as the `1 norm of a vector which captures differences of expectations
of analytic functions evaluated at spatial locations or frequencies (i.e, features).
The features can be chosen to maximize the differences of the distributions and
give interpretable indications of how they differs. Using an `1 norm gives better
detection because differences between representatives are dense as we use analytic
kernels (non-zero almost everywhere). The tests are consistent, while much faster
than state-of-the-art quadratic-time kernel-based tests. Experiments on artificial
and real-world problems demonstrate improved power/time tradeoff than the state

@article{josse2019consistency,
	Abstract = {In many application settings, the data have missing features which
make data analysis challenging. An abundant literature addresses
missing data in an inferential framework: estimating parameters and
their variance from incomplete tables. Here, we consider supervisedlearning settings: predicting a target when missing values appear in
both training and testing data.
We show the consistency of two approaches in prediction. A striking
result is that the widely-used method of imputing with the mean prior
to learning is consistent when missing values are not informative. This
contrasts with inferential settings where mean imputation is pointed
at for distorting the distribution of the data. That such a simple
approach can be consistent is important in practice. We also show that
a predictor suited for complete observations can predict optimally on
incomplete data, through multiple imputation.
We analyze further decision trees. These can naturally tackle empirical risk minimization with missing values, due to their ability to
handle the half-discrete nature of incomplete variables. After comparing theoretically and empirically different missing values strategies
in trees, we recommend using the ``missing incorporated in attribute''
method as it can handle both non-informative and informative missing
values.},

@article{pearl2009causal,
	Abstract = {This review presents empirical researchers with recent advances
in causal inference, and stresses the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of
multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and
the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims.
These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based
on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which
subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals.
In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for
inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three
types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interventions, (also called ``causal effects'' or ``policy evaluation'') (2) queries about
probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of ``regret,'' ``attribution'' or ``causes of effects'') and (3) queries about direct and indirect
effects (also known as ``mediation''). Finally, the paper defines the formal
and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome
frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong
features of both.},

policy and economics, for decades. Nowadays, estimating causal effect from observational data has become an appealing
research direction owing to the large amount of available data and low budget requirement, compared with randomized
controlled trials. Embraced with the rapidly developed machine learning area, various causal effect estimation methods for
observational data have sprung up. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of causal inference methods under the
potential outcome framework, one of the well known causal inference framework. The methods are divided into two categories
depending on whether they require all three assumptions of the potential outcome framework or not. For each category,
both the traditional statistical methods and the recent machine learning enhanced methods are discussed and compared.
The plausible applications of these methods are also presented, including the applications in advertising, recommendation,
medicine and so on. Moreover, the commonly used benchmark datasets as well as the open-source codes are also summarized,
which facilitate researchers and practitioners to explore, evaluate and apply the causal inference methods.},

* SUTVA (independence of the units receiving treatment, and unicity of treatments administred),

	Abstract = {Forecasting high-dimensional time series plays a crucial role in many applications
such as demand forecasting and financial predictions. Modern datasets can have
millions of correlated time-series that evolve together, i.e they are extremely high
dimensional (one dimension for each individual time-series). There is a need
for exploiting global patterns and coupling them with local calibration for better
prediction. However, most recent deep learning approaches in the literature are
one-dimensional, i.e, even though they are trained on the whole dataset, during
prediction, the future forecast for a single dimension mainly depends on past values
from the same dimension. In this paper, we seek to correct this deficiency and
propose DeepGLO, a deep forecasting model which thinks globally and acts
locally. In particular, DeepGLO is a hybrid model that combines a global matrix
factorization model regularized by a temporal convolution network, along with
another temporal network that can capture local properties of each time-series and
associated covariates. Our model can be trained effectively on high-dimensional
but diverse time series, where different time series can have vastly different scales,
without a priori normalization or rescaling. Empirical results demonstrate that
DeepGLO can outperform state-of-the-art approaches; for example, we see more
than 25% improvement in WAPE over other methods on a public dataset that
contains more than 100K-dimensional time series.},

	Abstract = {Time series prediction problems are becoming increasingly high-dimensional in
modern applications, such as climatology and demand forecasting. For example,
in the latter problem, the number of items for which demand needs to be forecast
might be as large as 50,000. In addition, the data is generally noisy and full of
missing values. Thus, modern applications require methods that are highly scalable,
and can deal with noisy data in terms of corruptions or missing values. However,
classical time series methods usually fall short of handling these issues. In this
paper, we present a temporal regularized matrix factorization (TRMF) framework
which supports data-driven temporal learning and forecasting. We develop novel
regularization schemes and use scalable matrix factorization methods that are
eminently suited for high-dimensional time series data that has many missing values.
Our proposed TRMF is highly general, and subsumes many existing approaches
for time series analysis. We make interesting connections to graph regularization
methods in the context of learning the dependencies in an autoregressive framework.
Experimental results show the superiority of TRMF in terms of scalability and
prediction quality. In particular, TRMF is two orders of magnitude faster than
other methods on a problem of dimension 50,000, and generates better forecasts on
real-world datasets such as Wal-mart E-commerce datasets.},

recently. It is a non-trivial problem because of the inherent high dimensionality of the data. The
most promising solutions involve performing dimensionality reduction on the data, then indexing
the reduced data with a spatial access method. Three major dimensionality reduction techniques
have been proposed, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the Discrete Fourier transform
(DFT), and more recently the Discrete Wavelets Transform (DWT). In this work we introduce a
new dimensionality reduction technique which we call PAA (Piecewise Aggregate
Approximation). We theoretically and empirically compare it to the other techniques and
demonstrate its superiority. In addition to being competitive with or faster than the other methods
our approach has numerous advantages. It is simple to understand and implement, allows more
flexible distance measures including weighted Euclidean queries and the index can be built in

Further, we examine the multi-scale jump dynamics in US equity markets. The main findings are as
follows. First, the jump dynamics of equities are sensitive to data sampling frequency with significant
underestimation of jump intensities at lower frequencies. Second, although arrival densities of positive
jumps and negative jumps are symmetric across different time scales, the magnitude of jumps is
distributed asymmetrically at high frequencies. Third, only 20% of jumps occur in the trading session
from 9:30AM to 4:00 PM, suggesting that illiquidity during after-hours trading is a strong determinant
of jumps.},

Long, extensive, and interesting blog post. It tries to list all different methods to estimate causality in time series data.

All methods could be grouped in 2 categories:
* test based: runing statistical test to determinie if ts1 Granger-causes ts2
* graph based: generate a Bayesian NN 

There would need to be a summary table of the different methods with their strengths/weaknesses -> time consuming + is it the best approach? Should I just focus on PCMCI

- the work of Runge: for graphical model, check out PMCI (https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/5/11/eaau4996.full.pdf / https://github.com/jakobrunge/tigramite)


Focus on graphical approaches immediately? Probably need a rationale to do so -> study other methods briefly, or check with Alex

What is the advantage of graphical methods over statistical tests?

* Graphical approach: often used to model Granger causality in multivariate setting

	Abstract = {Discriminative neural networks offer little or no performance guarantees when
deployed on data not generated by the same process as the training distribution. On
such out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, the prediction may not only be erroneous,
but confidently so, limiting the safe deployment of classifiers in real-world applications. One such challenging application is bacteria identification based on genomic
sequences, which holds the promise of early detection of diseases, but requires a
model that can output low confidence predictions on OOD genomic sequences from
new bacteria that were not present in the training data. We introduce a genomics
dataset for OOD detection that allows other researchers to benchmark progress on
this important problem. We investigate deep generative model based approaches
for OOD detection and observe that the likelihood score is heavily affected by
population level background statistics. We propose a likelihood ratio method for
deep generative models which effectively corrects for these confounding background statistics. We benchmark the OOD detection performance of the proposed
method against existing approaches on the genomics dataset and show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We demonstrate the generality of
the proposed method by showing that it significantly improves OOD detection
when applied to deep generative models of images.},
	Annote = {Research stemmed from a OOD problem in genomic, and they try to generalize it to image classification. This project stems from the limitation of existing generative-based methods for OOD; they show examples in both domains where the likelihood OOD is at least as confident as in-distribution.
Their solution is to split input into background and semantic (independence assumption), and apply a likelihood ration only to the semantic part.

It's not clear why their assumptions would be valid outside (even inside) of genomics. For instance, backgroud play a big role in confounding image classifiers (e.g., wolf in front of grass).

However, there is a nice section at the beginning of section 4 that summarizes the ``Baseline methods for comparison'':
1. The maximum class probability, p(ˆy|x) = maxk p(y = k|x). OOD inputs tend to have lower
scores than in-distribution data (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016).
2. The entropy of the predicted class distribution, − P_k p(y = k|x) log p(y = k|x). High entropy
of the predicted class distribution, and therefore a high predictive uncertainty, which suggests that
the input may be OOD.
3. The ODIN method proposed by Liang et al. (2017). ODIN uses temperature scaling (Guo et al.,
2017), adds small perturbations to the input, and applies a threshold to the resulting predicted
class to distinguish in- and out-of- distribution inputs. This method was designed for continuous
inputs and cannot be directly applied to discrete genomic sequences. We propose instead to add
perturbations to the input of the last layer that is closest to the output of the neural network.
4. The Mahalanobis distance of the input to the nearest class-conditional Gaussian distribution estimated from the in-distribution data. Lee et al. (2018) fit class-conditional Gaussian distributions
to the activations from the last layer of the neural network.
5. The classifier-based ensemble method that uses the average of the predictions from multiple
independently trained models with random initialization of network parameters and random
shuffling of training inputs (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017).
6. The log-odds of a binary classifier trained to distinguish between in-distribution inputs from all
classes as one class and randomly perturbed in-distribution inputs as the other.
7. The maximum class probability over K in-distribution classes of a (K + 1)-class classifier where
the additional class is perturbed in-distribution.
8. The maximum class probability of a K-class classifier for in-distribution classes but the predicted
class distribution is explicitly trained to output uniform distribution on perturbed in-distribution
inputs. This is similar to using simulated OOD inputs from GAN (Lee et al., 2017) or using
auxiliary datasets of outliers (Hendrycks et al., 2018) for calibration purpose.
9. The generative model-based ensemble method that measures E[log pθ(x)] − Var[log pθ(x)] of
multiple likelihood estimations from independently trained model with random initialization and
random shuffling of the inputs. (Choi et al., 2018).},

	Abstract = {Finding the right Neural Network model and
training it for a new task requires considerable expertise
and extensive computational resources. Moreover, the process
often includes ad-hoc rules that do not generalize to different
application domains. These issues have limited the applicability
and usefulness of DNN models, especially for new learning
tasks. This problem is becoming more acute, as datasets and
models grow larger, which increases training time, making
random/brute force search approaches quickly untenable. In
large part, this situation is due to the first-order stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods that are widely-used for training
DNNs. Despite SGD's well-known benefits, vanilla SGD tends
to perform poorly, and thus one introduces many (essentially
ad-hoc) knobs and hyper-parameters to make it work. It has
been found that these hyper-parameters are significantly more
sensitive to tuning in large scale training with SGD, and this
has impeded effective use of supercomputing systems. Here,
we argue that a multi-faceted approach is needed to address
these challenges by considering the full stack of neural network
architecture design, large scale training, and efficient inference
on edge platforms. This requires designing mechanisms to
better understand NN training and bridge the gap between
theoretical results for optimization, second order methods, and
high performance computing.},

	Abstract = {Time series clustering is an essential unsupervised technique in cases when category
information is not available. It has been widely applied to genome data, anomaly
detection, and in general, in any domain where pattern detection is important.
Although feature-based time series clustering methods are robust to noise and
outliers, and can reduce the dimensionality of the data, they typically rely on domain
knowledge to manually construct high-quality features. Sequence to sequence
(seq2seq) models can learn representations from sequence data in an unsupervised
manner by designing appropriate learning objectives, such as reconstruction and
context prediction. When applying seq2seq to time series clustering, obtaining a
representation that effectively represents the temporal dynamics of the sequence,
multi-scale features, and good clustering properties remains a challenge. How
to best improve the ability of the encoder is still an open question. Here we
propose a novel unsupervised temporal representation learning model, named
Deep Temporal Clustering Representation (DTCR), which integrates the temporal
reconstruction and K-means objective into the seq2seq model. This approach
leads to improved cluster structures and thus obtains cluster-specific temporal
representations. Also, to enhance the ability of encoder, we propose a fake-sample
generation strategy and auxiliary classification task. Experiments conducted on
extensive time series datasets show that DTCR is state-of-the-art compared to
existing methods. The visualization analysis not only shows the effectiveness of
cluster-specific representation but also shows the learning process is robust, even if
K-means makes mistakes.},

The k-means loss applies to the centroids but also the encoder; for stability reason, the centroids are updated less frequently than the network weights (every 10 epochs in the paper). 
They added a classifier to improve the quality of the reconstruction; they generate fake time series by randomly permutating the entries of the real ones.

Interesting paper overall. Seems a bit convoluted, but show SOTA results on a few of the UCR classification datasets.},

Among many approaches, the simplest and most intuitive way is zero imputation,
which treats the value of a missing entry simply as zero. However, many studies
have experimentally confirmed that zero imputation results in suboptimal performances in training neural networks. Yet, none of the existing work has explained
what brings such performance degradations. In this paper, we introduce the variable sparsity problem (VSP), which describes a phenomenon where the output
of a predictive model largely varies with respect to the rate of missingness in the
given input, and show that it adversarially affects the model performance. We first
theoretically analyze this phenomenon and propose a simple yet effective technique
to handle missingness, which we refer to as Sparsity Normalization (SN), that
directly targets and resolves the VSP. We further experimentally validate SN on
diverse benchmark datasets, to show that debiasing the effect of input-level sparsity
improves the performance and stabilizes the training of neural networks.},

train modern network architectures with millions of weights and millions of hyperparameters. We learn a data-augmentation network---
where every weight is a hyperparameter tuned
for validation performance---that outputs augmented training examples; we learn a distilled
dataset where each feature in each datapoint
is a hyperparameter; and we tune millions
of regularization hyperparameters. Jointly
tuning weights and hyperparameters with our
approach is only a few times more costly in
memory and compute than standard training.},
